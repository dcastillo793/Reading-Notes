# Scripting Summary  
# Daniel Castillo
# 12 August 2021

Repo allows me to share my code with the internet. I can also look at code created by other people. It's basically a social media platofrm specific to
people that create scripts/code. I'm learning these skills to be able to move up and out of the help desk when its time to make that leap in my future
cyber security career. I learned a ton, although I'm not confident in it. Fundamentally, I think I'm more aware of networks, virtualization, and how
to use a firewall and an antivrus to help ensure PC purity. I think I enjoyed the Labs more than the Ops Challenges because I could at least use the
GUI at times. I'm defintiely inclined to learn more scripting though. I enjoyed the malware assignment the most. All of the scripts that we wrote in 
class have applications in the operational environment. There are a few scripts I didn't quite get to work. I would like to re-work those ones. I can
functions, loops, and variables, but I would like to work on the more complex scripting where I have to combine these things to achieve something.
